## Concept
- Testing Suites are configurations in XML format that allows us to group and manage multiple test classes and methods and methods
- They provide a structured approach to execute our tests in batches or specific orders
- By defining suites we can categorize our tests based on:
	- Functionality
	- Modules
	- Testing Requirements
- Benefits of using TestNG Suites include:
	- Better test management
	- Easier maintenance
	- Improved test execution control
- Allow for parallel execution of tests, reducing overall test execution time
- Facilitates the integration of tests into CI/CD pipelines enabling automated triggers of test batches as part of the SDLC
