## Organization of tests
- TestNG allows for organization of tests into:
	- Methods
	- Classes
	- Groups
## Parameters and DataProviders
- @Parameters
	- This annotation helps inject values directly into test methods
- DataProviders
	- Allows a single test method to run with multiple sets of data
## Parallel Execution in TestNG
- Allows us to run multiple tests simultaneously
## Rerunning Failed Tests
- Allows us to rerun tests that failed
## TestNG Listeners
- Allows us to modify how tests run making the testing process more specific to our needs
- They enable us to execute certain actions at different points in the test cycle
