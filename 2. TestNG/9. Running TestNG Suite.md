## Overview
- Discover how to run a TestNG Suite within:
	- IntelliJ (through TestNG)
	- Command Line (through Maven using the Surefire plugin)
		- Necessary for CI/CD pipelines
## Execute Groups of Tests
- Through IDE
	- You can invoke TestNG in several different ways:
		- With a `testng.xml` file
		- With `ant`
		- From the command line
	- We'll look at `testng.xml` file
	- Set up the `testng.xml` file with code from [TestNG](https://testng.org/#_testng_xml)
		- Look up [[8. How to set up Regression TestNG Suite]] for the appropriate attribute values
	- Open the `testng.xml` file and just run it like you would any other program
- Through Command Line
	- In order to run the test suite .xml file through the command line you have to add configuration to the Maven Surefire plugin in the pom.xml file, this is the stuff you add (can be found at [TestNG-Using Suite XML files](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/testng.html))
	- Copy the 'Path from content root' of your test suite .xml file
```xml
<build>  
    <plugins>  
        <plugin>  
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>  
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>  
            <version>3.5.2</version>  
            <configuration>  
                <suiteXmlFiles>
<!-- This should point to your Test Suite .xml file -->                <suiteXmlFile>src/test/resources/TestSuites/FullRegressionSuite.xml</suiteXmlFile> 
                </suiteXmlFiles>  
            </configuration>  
        </plugin>  
    </plugins>  
</build>
```
- Navigate to root of project in command line
- Type `mvn test` | `mvn clean test
## Maven Surefire Plugin
- The Surefire Plugin is used during the `test` phase of the build lifecycle to **execute the unit tests of an application**
- It generates reports in two different file formats:
	- Plain text files (`*.txt`)
	- XML files (`*.xml`)
- By default, these files are generated in `${basedir}/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml`
- Ensures that all tests are executed and the build process is influenced by the test result, which is critical for CI environment
