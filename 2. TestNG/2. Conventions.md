## Class Name Naming Convention
- Include the word `Tests` either at the beginning or end of the class name
- For Maven projects this isn't just a convention but a necessity
	- The `surefire` plugin, which Maven uses to identify and run tests, relies on it
	- Without `Tests` in your class name `surefire` might overlook your test and you they won't be executed as part of your build process
## Package Organization
- Organizing tests into packages can improve the manageability of your test code
- Group related tests together in a package
- By using a consistent package name scheme, such as reflecting the feature set or user story being tested, we establish a clear project structure which is beneficial when working on a large project or a large number of tests
## Test Method
- Basics
	- A test method is simply a public method that is intended to test a particular aspect of the application
- Naming Convention
	- Descriptive, reflecting the specific functionality it tests
- Accessibility and Return Type
	- Should be declared as public
	- Void return type
- Arguments
	- Test methods typically should not take arguments
	- They should be designed to handle all necessary steps within the method itself, maintaining independence from other tests to prevent any dependencies that could affect the test outcome
## Variables
- `actual` and `expected`
