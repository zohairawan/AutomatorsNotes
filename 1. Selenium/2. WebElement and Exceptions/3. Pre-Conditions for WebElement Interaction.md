## Pre-Conditions
- Selenium does not blindly execute actions before interaction
- Selenium verifies that the web element is:
	- Within the viewport (**visible**)
	- Actually an interactable element (**interactable**)
- If an element is hidden or outside the user's visible area Selenium will attempt to scroll to it
- If an element is covered by another element or otherwise not accessible for interaction, Selenium will report it as non interactable
## Summary
- Pre-conditions for WebElement interaction are:
	- **Visible**
	- **Interactable**
