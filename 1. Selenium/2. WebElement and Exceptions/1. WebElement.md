## WebElement - What is it?
- WebElement is a class
- This class is fundamental for interacting with web elements
- A WebElement is an object that represents an element on a web page
- It allows us to interact with input boxes, buttons, links, and more
## Creating WebElements
- `WebElement vegetables = driver.findElementBy(By.className("tomatoes"));`
	- This finds the first element that matches this class name
	- Saves element into `vegetables` variable of `WebElement` type
## Locating nested elements
- Option 1:
	- `WebElement fruits = driver.findElement(By.id("fruits"));`
		- Locates the entire fruit section and saves it as `fruits`
	- `WebElement fruit = fruits.findElement(By.className("tomatoes"));`
		- Locates the specific tomato element within the `fruits` WebElement
		- This 2 step process allows us to precisely pinpoint elements nested within larger groups
- Option 2:
	- `WebElement fruit = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#fruits.tomatoes"));`
		- Combines the ID of the fruits section with the class of the tomato element to indicate that tomato is within the fruit section
		- Achieves same outcome as Option 1 but done in 1 step instead of 2
