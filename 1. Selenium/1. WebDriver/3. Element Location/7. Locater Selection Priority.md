## Overview
- Deciding how to pick the best locators for your tests

## Locater Selection Priority
- ID
	- Typically unique to each element and make it easy for Selenium to find them
	- However, it's crucial that these ID's remain unique and consistent over time
- CSS Selectors
	- Almost as fast as ID's and can locate complex elements
	- Preferred for their simplicity and performance especially when dealing with complex elements
	- Most front-end developers know it, so if you need to explain issues with test automation to developers it should be easy for them to know what you're talking about
- XPath
	- Slightly slower and a bit more complicated than CSS Selectors
	- However, XPath's offer the most flexibility
