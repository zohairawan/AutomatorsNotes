## Locators - What are They?
- The backbone of effective web automation
- Locators in Selenium are the **strategies/methods** we use to identify elements on a web page
- Think of locators as the GPS for Selenium, guiding it to find the web elements you want to interact with
- Locators function as the bridge between our tests and web page elements we want to interact with
- Whether it's clicking a button, typing into a text field, or reading text from a web page, it all starts with locating the element accurately
## Best Practices for Locator Usage
- Effective locator strategy emphasizes the use of **unique** and **stable identifiers** to ensure test's reliability
- Abstracting locator definitions improves maintainability, allowing for easier updates as applications 
- It's important to find the right mix of being **precise** and **adaptable** to prevent tests from failing due to small changes in the user interface
## Unique vs. Multiple Element Locaters
- We generally prefer unique locators for their readability and directness
- However there might be scenarios where you need to interact with multiple elements sharing the same attribute, such as processing lists or tables
- In these cases, choosing locators that match can multiple elements becomes necessary, balancing the need for specificity with the ability to generalize across similar elements
