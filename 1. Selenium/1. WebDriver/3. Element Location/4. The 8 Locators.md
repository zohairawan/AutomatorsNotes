## Selenium Locators
- Selenium WebDriver provides 8 locators that you can use to locate HTML elements on a webpage
- Selenium has the Traditional 8 locators and Selenium 4 introduced new Relative Locators
## 8 Locators
- Simple
	- ID
	- Name
	- Class Name
	- Tag Name
	- Link Text
	- Partial Link Text
- Advanced
	- CSS Selector
	- XPath
## ID
- Locates elements whose ID attribute value matches the search value
- **Perfect for uniquely identifying an element**
- ID's can be dynamic, meaning it will change on every page reload
- `id` is an actual HTML element attribute
## Name
- Locates elements whose name attribute value matches the search value
- **Can be used to locate a group of elements sharing the same name**
- **Useful for forms, buttons, or elements with common attributes**
- `name` is an actual HTML element attribute
## Class Name
- Locates elements whose class name attribute value contains the search value
- **Can be used to locate a group of elements sharing the same class name**
- **Useful for forms, buttons, or elements with common attributes**
- Compound class names are not permitted
- Limitations come when such attributes are not unique or change frequently
- Locate an element using its CSS class name attribute
- `class` is an actual HTML element attribute
## Tag Name
- Locates elements whose tag name matches the search value
- **Can be used to locate a group of elements sharing the same tag name**
- **Useful for forms, buttons, or elements with common attributes**
- Every element will have a tag but it's not a good way to uniquely identify an element
## Link Text
- Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value
- **Perfect for dealing with anchor tags**
- Applies only to hyperlink text
- Matches the full text
## Partial Link Text
- Locates anchor elements whose visible text contains the search value
- **Perfect for dealing with anchor tags**
- **Useful for links with long text**
- **Useful for dealing with dynamic text portions**
- Applies only to hyperlink text
- If multiple elements are matching then only the first one will be selected
## CSS Selector
- Locates elements matching the CSS Selector
- **Adept at navigating through nested elements and hierarchies**
- **Adept at locating elements that have specific stylistic criteria**
- Preferred choice for tests that require a nuanced approach to element selection
- Allows testers to target elements based on their styling attributes such as ID's, classes, or other properties
- Stands out due to its **readability and efficiency especially when dealing with complex document structures**
- Utilize the styling path defined in the HTML and CSS to pinpoint elements
- Remarkably precise and fast
- Does not rely on one specific attribute
- Allows you to decide how to locate element
- Good balance between structure and attribute
## XPath
- Locates elements matching an XPath expression
- **Unmatched ability to navigate through the entirety of the DOM**
- **Easily deal with elements that change a lot or are buried deep in a page**
- **Its ability to make detailed searches makes it the strongest tool we have for making sure we can always find what we need**
- Can find any element on the page
- Extremely flexibly and exact
- Locates an element using an XPath expression
- 2 types of XPath
	- Absolute - starts from the starting node of the DOM
		- / single forward slash
	- Relative - can start from any node/tag name in the DOM
		- // double forward slash
- Does not rely on one specific attribute
- Allows you to decide how to locate element
- XPath or XML Path Language is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document
- It can also be used to compute values from the content of an XML document
- XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document
- The node is selected by following a path or steps
- XPath is like a address given in a specific format
