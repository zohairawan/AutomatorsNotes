## Importance of HTML Element Location
- Choosing the right locator strategy ensures your tests are both robust and resilient
- Element location is a cornerstone of Selenium WebDriver, enabling us to programmatically interact with web pages
- From clicking buttons, inputting text, and extracting data, Selenium must accurately find elements to carry out these actions
- As such, we will focus on mastering element location strategies
## Locater Strategies Overview
- In Selenium we use locator strategies to interact with web elements
- Traditional locators
	- id, name, class name, tag name, link text, partial link text, css selector, and xpath
- Relative Locators
	- above, below, toLeftOf, toRightOf, near
## HTML Tags, Attributes, and Values
- HTML tags, attributes, and values are core components of HTML
- HTML tags, attributes, and values are pivotal concepts for effective element location and interaction with web page elements in our Selenium scripts
- Selenium will use html tags, attributes, or values to locate and interact with elements
- HTML tags, attributes, or values will tell Selenium how to distinguish one element from another
## Summary
- By using HTML tags, attributes, or values we can uniquely identify web elements
