## Why Verify?
- You can only verify **CSS Selectors** and **XPath Expressions**, not the other 6 locators using "Developer Tools"
- Verifying our CSS and XPath locators ensures they are targeting the correct element
- You should first test your locators in the console before incorporating them into your script
- This verification strategy allows us to quickly check and confirm that our locators are precise and functional
- Validation occurs in 'Developer Tools' (F12 or Right-Click -> 'Inspect')
## Validate that your element is unique (1 of 1)
- Console (Dev Tools) - Type this into the console
	- **XPath:** `$x("XPathExpression")`
	- **CSS:**  `$$("cssSelector")`
- DOM/Inspector (Dev Tools) - Ctrl + f to search the DOM
	- **XPath:** `XPathExpression`
	- **CSS Selector**
		- `tagname[attribute='attributeValue']`
		- ID
			- `tagname#IDAttributeValue` or `#IDAttributeValue`
		- Class Name
			- `tagname.classname` or `.classname`
## Searching for Elements in the DOM
- Ctrl + f in DOM
	- Find HTML tag
		- `//tagName`
	- Find attribute
		- Just type in attribute name you're looking for
