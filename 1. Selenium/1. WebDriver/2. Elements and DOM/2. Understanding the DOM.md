## DOM - What is it?
![[DOM.png|950]]
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows code to interact with HTML or XML documents
- The DOM is a dynamic representation of a web page's structure, allowing programs like Selenium to interact with and manipulate web elements.
- When a web page is loaded the browser creates a DOM of the page
- View DOM by pressing F12 or Right-Click -> 'Inspect' on a web page
## Relationship between DOM and HTML
- **The DOM is a programming interface provided by browsers representing the contents of a web page as a tree of nodes**
- This interface allows scripts to interact dynamically with the web page's content and structure
- It's a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements
## Importance of the DOM in Web Applications
- The DOM's ability to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of the webpage is what makes modern web applications interactive and responsive, improving user experience
## Interacting with the DOM
- Through programming languages like JavaScript, developers can manipulate the DOM to create dynamic interactions within web pages, allowing for real time content updates and responsive design
## How Selenium WebDriver Interacts with the DOM
- Selenium WebDriver allows you to interact with the DOM
- By interacting with the DOM you can identify and manipulate web elements
- This interaction is essential for automating user actions like clicking buttons, entering text, and extracting data from web pages
## Summary
- The DOM is an essential concept for web automation, serving as the bridge between Selenium WebDriver scripts and the web pages they automate
