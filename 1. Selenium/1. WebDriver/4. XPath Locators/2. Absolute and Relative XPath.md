## Types of XPath
- Absolute
- Relative
## Absolute XPath
- Starts with /
- Easiest way of finding the XPath
- Direct way to locate an element
- Starts from the root node
- Not reliable
	- Any change to the UI where an element is added in between our element and the root the absolute XPath won't work
- `/html/body/div/div/section/section/div/div/div/input`
## Relative XPath
- Starts with //
- Starts from the node of your choice
- Shorter than XPath
- More reliable
- `//div[@id='row1']/input`
