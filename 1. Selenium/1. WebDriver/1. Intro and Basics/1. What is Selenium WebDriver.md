 - Selenium WebDriver
 - Selenium RC (Remote Control) (Deprecated)
 - Selenium Grid
 - Selenium IDE
## Selenium WebDriver - What is it?
- Open-source automation tool
- Commonly used to test web applications by simulating user actions
- Used for automating web browsers
- Exclusively for web based applications
	- Anything that you see on the web browser can be automated using Selenium
- Enables you to:
	- Simulate user interactions
	- Verify web application functionality
- Provides a programming interface for:
	- Interacting with web elements
	- Performing actions on web pages
	- Retrieving data from them
## Selenium - Pros
- Rich Selection of Locators
	- WebDriver offers a wide range of methods and strategies for locating web elements on a page including:
		- Element IDs
		- Class Names
		- CSS Selectors
		- XPath
		- More...
	- This flexibility makes it easier to interact with elements and perform actions during test automation
- Robust Interactions and Simulations
	- Selenium WebDriver allows you to simulate various user interactions with web elements such as:
		- Clicking buttons
		- Filling out forms
		- Submitting data
		- Handling alerts or pop-ups
	- Selenium WebDriver allows for advanced interactions including:
		- Drag-and-Drop
		- Keyboard input
		- Mouse actions
- Integration with Testing Frameworks
	- Selenium WebDriver integrates well with popular testing frameworks/libraries like TestNG, JUnit, and Cucumber providing advanced test management and reporting capabilities
	- Allows you to:
		- Organize and execute tests in a structured manner
		- Generate test reports
		- Integrate with continuous integration (CI) and continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines
- Parallel Test Execution
	- Selenium WebDriver can be used in conjunction with Selenium Grid or other parallel test execution frameworks to execute tests across multiple machines or browsers simultaneously, reducing the overall test execution time and improves efficiency
- Open-Source and Cost-Effective
	- Selenium WebDriver is an open-source tool, which means it is freely available for use and modification
	- This makes it a cost-effective choice for test automation, particularly for projects with budget constraints
- Language Support
	- Provides language bindings for popular programming languages
- Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Extensive Community Support
## Selenium - Cons
- Steep Learning Curve
- Lack of Built-in Reporting
	- Selenium WebDriver does not provide built-in reporting capabilities
	- Test reporting and result analysis need to be implemented separately using external libraries of frameworks
- Synchronization Issues
	- Web applications often have dynamic elements that load asynchronously or require additional time to appear or update
	- Synchronizing test scripts with such elements can be challenging and it may require explicit waits or handling complex synchronization scenarios
- Execution Speed
- Complex Setup and Environment Configuration
	- Setting up the Selenium WebDriver environment including, installing browser drivers, configuring dependencies, and maintaining compatibility across browsers and versions, can be complex and time-consuming
- Limited Support for CAPTCHA and Pop ups
- Cannot automate MFA scenarios
- Cannot verify contents of images and videos
